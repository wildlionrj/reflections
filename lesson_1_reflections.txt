How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    It cleared the clutter, allowing me to focus on the lines that had actually changed between versions

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    Sometimes one eror might mask another, and by focusing on solving the first one, we loose track of the changes made to the rest of the code.  Keeping a version control will help with that.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    You will get full working versions of the code, if you save when you have finished changing the files.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I will guess to keep the full code versioned together, so we do not mix different versions of the files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? 

    Use git log to see the different commits to your repo, and git diff to see the differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    It makes the process of finding where the bugs started to happen easier, by accessing the different versions

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To keep my documents and their respective changes safe
